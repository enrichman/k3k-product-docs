document provides advanced usage information for k3k, including detailed use cases and explanations of the Cluster resource fields for customization. The Cluster resource provides a variety of fields for customizing the behavior of your virtual clusters. See CRD documentation for the full specifications. Most of these customization options can also be configured using the k3kcli tool. Refer to k3kcli documentation for more details. This example creates a \"shared\" mode K3k cluster with: 3 servers K3s version v1.31.3-k3s1 Custom network configuration Deployment on specific nodes with the nodeSelector kube-api exposed using an ingress Custom K3s serverArgs ETCD data persisted using a PVC apiVersion: k3k.io/v1beta1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: my-virtual-cluster namespace: my-namespace spec: mode: shared version: v1.31.3-k3s1 servers: 3 tlsSANs: - my-cluster.example.com nodeSelector: disktype: ssd expose: ingress: ingressClassName: nginx annotations: nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough: \"true\" nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: \"true\" nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: \"HTTPS\" clusterCIDR: 10.42.0.0/16 serviceCIDR: 10.43.0.0/16 clusterDNS: 10.43.0.10 serverArgs: - --tls-san=my-cluster.example.com persistence: type: dynamic storageClassName: local-path The mode field specifies the cluster provisioning mode, which can be either shared or virtual. The default mode is shared. shared mode: In this mode, the virtual cluster shares the host cluster’s resources and networking. This mode is suitable for lightweight workloads and development environments where isolation is not a primary concern. virtual mode: In this mode, the virtual cluster runs as a separate K3s cluster within the host cluster. This mode provides stronger isolation and is suitable for production workloads or when dedicated resources are required. The version field specifies the Kubernetes version to be used by the virtual nodes. If not specified, K3k will use the same K3s version as the host cluster. For example, if the host cluster is running Kubernetes v1.31.3, K3k will use the corresponding K3s version (e.g., v1.31.3-k3s1). The servers field specifies the number of K3s server nodes to deploy for the virtual cluster. The default value is 1. The agents field specifies the number of K3s agent nodes to deploy for the virtual cluster. The default value is 0. In shared mode, this field is ignored, as the Virtual Kubelet acts as the agent, and there are no K3s worker nodes. The nodeSelector field allows you to specify a node selector that will be applied to all server/agent pods. In shared mode, the node selector will also be applied to the workloads. The expose field contains options for exposing the API server of the virtual cluster. By default, the API server is only exposed as a ClusterIP, which is relatively secure but difficult to access from outside the cluster. You can use the expose field to enable exposure via NodePort, LoadBalancer, or Ingress. In this example we are exposing the Cluster with a Nginx ingress-controller, that has to be configured with the --enable-ssl-passthrough flag. The clusterCIDR field specifies the CIDR range for the pods of the cluster. The default value is 10.42.0.0/16 in shared mode, and 10.52.0.0/16 in virtual mode. The serviceCIDR field specifies the CIDR range for the services in the cluster. The default value is 10.43.0.0/16 in shared mode, and 10.53.0.0/16 in virtual mode. In shared mode, the serviceCIDR should match the host cluster’s serviceCIDR to prevent conflicts and in virtual mode both serviceCIDR and clusterCIDR should be different than the host cluster. The clusterDNS field specifies the IP address for the CoreDNS service. It needs to be in the range provided by serviceCIDR. The default value is 10.43.0.10. The serverArgs field allows you to specify additional arguments to be passed to the K3s server pods. You can check the k3kcli documentation for the full specs. Ephemeral Storage: k3kcli cluster create --persistence-type ephemeral my-cluster Using --persistence-type ephemeral will result in data loss if the nodes are restarted.

K3k leverages K3s as the control plane of the Kubernetes cluster because of its lightweight footprint. K3k provides two modes for deploying virtual clusters: - Shared (default) - Virtual The default shared mode uses a K3s server as control plane with an agentless servers configuration. With this option enabled, the servers do not run the kubelet, container runtime, or CNI. The server uses a Virtual Kubelet provider implementation specific to K3k, which schedules the workloads and other eventually needed resources on the host cluster. This K3k Virtual Kubelet provider handles the reflection of resources and workload execution within the shared host cluster environment. Because of this shared infrastructure, the CNI is the same as the one configured in the host cluster. The same goes for the available storage where the Storage Classes and Volumes are those of the host cluster. To provide the needed isolation, K3k leverages Network Policies. In shared mode, K3k leverages Kubernetes 'ResourceQuotas' and 'LimitRanges' to manage resource sharing and enforce limits. Since all virtual cluster workloads run within the same namespace on the host cluster, ResourceQuotas are applied to this namespace to limit the total resources consumed by a virtual cluster. LimitRanges are used to set default resource requests and limits for pods, ensuring that workloads have reasonable resource allocations even if they do not explicitly specify them. Each pod in a virtual cluster is assigned a unique name that incorporates the pod name, namespace and cluster name. This prevents naming collisions in the shared host cluster namespace. It is important to understand that ResourceQuotas are applied at the namespace level. This means that all pods within a virtual cluster share the same quota. While this provides overall limits for the virtual cluster, it also means that resource allocation is dynamic. If one workload is not using its full resource allocation, other workloads within the same virtual cluster can utilize those resources, even if they belong to different deployments or services. This dynamic sharing can be both a benefit and a challenge. It allows for efficient resource utilization, but it can also lead to unpredictable performance if workloads have varying resource demands. Furthermore, this approach makes it difficult to guarantee strict resource isolation between workloads within the same virtual cluster. GPU resource sharing is an area of ongoing investigation. K3k is actively exploring potential solutions in this area. Isolation between virtual clusters in shared mode relies heavily on Kubernetes Network Policies. Network Policies define rules that control the network traffic allowed to and from pods. K3k configures Network Policies to ensure that pods in one virtual cluster cannot communicate with pods in other virtual clusters or with pods in the host cluster itself, providing a strong foundation for network isolation. While Network Policies offer robust isolation capabilities, it is important to understand their characteristics: CNI Integration: Network Policies integrate seamlessly with supported CNI plugins. K3k leverages this integration to enforce network isolation. Granular Control: Network Policies provide granular control over network traffic, allowing for fine-tuned security policies. Scalability: Network Policies scale well with the number of virtual clusters and applications, ensuring consistent isolation as the environment grows. K3k also utilizes Kubernetes Pod Security Admission (PSA) to enforce security policies within virtual clusters based on Pod Security Standards (PSS). PSS define different levels of security for pods, restricting what actions pods can perform. By configuring PSA to enforce a specific PSS level (for example, baseline or restricted) for a virtual cluster, K3k ensures that pods adhere to established security best practices and prevents them from using privileged features or performing potentially dangerous operations. Key aspects of PSA integration include: Namespace-Level Enforcement: PSA configuration is applied at the namespace level, providing a consistent security posture for all pods within the virtual cluster. Standardized Profiles: PSS offers a set of predefined security profiles aligned with industry best practices, simplifying security configuration and ensuring a baseline level of security. The shared mode architecture is designed with security in mind. K3k employs multiple layers of security controls, including Network Policies and PSA, to protect virtual clusters and the host cluster. While the shared namespace model requires careful configuration and management, these controls provide a robust security foundation for running workloads in a multi-tenant environment. K3k continuously evaluates and enhances its security mechanisms to address evolving threats and ensure the highest level of protection for its users. The virtual mode in K3k deploys fully functional K3s clusters (including both server and agent components) as virtual clusters. These K3s clusters run as pods within the host cluster. Each virtual cluster has its own dedicated K3s server and one or more K3s agents acting as worker nodes. This approach provides strong isolation, as each virtual cluster operates independently with its own control plane and worker nodes. While these virtual clusters run as pods on the host cluster, they function as complete and separate Kubernetes environments. Virtual clusters in virtual mode each have their own independent networking configuration managed by their respective K3s servers. Each virtual cluster runs its own CNI plugin, configured within its K3s server, providing complete network isolation from other virtual clusters and the host cluster. While the virtual cluster networks ultimately operate on top of the host cluster’s network infrastructure, the networking configuration and traffic management are entirely separate. Resource sharing in virtual mode is managed by applying resource limits to the pods that make up the virtual cluster (both the K3s server pod and the K3s agent pods). Each pod is assigned a specific amount of CPU, memory, and other resources. The workloads running within the virtual cluster then utilize these allocated resources. This means that the virtual cluster as a whole has a defined resource pool determined by the limits on its constituent pods. This approach provides a clear and direct way to control the resources available to each virtual cluster. However, it requires careful resource planning to ensure that each virtual cluster has sufficient capacity for its workloads. The virtual mode offers strong isolation due to the dedicated K3s clusters deployed for each virtual cluster. Because each virtual cluster runs its own separate control plane and worker nodes, workloads are effectively isolated from each other and from the host cluster. This architecture minimizes the risk of one virtual cluster impacting others or the host cluster. Security in virtual mode benefits from the inherent isolation provided by the separate K3s clusters. However, standard Kubernetes security best practices still apply, and K3k emphasizes a layered security approach. While the K3s server pods often run with elevated privileges (due to the nature of their function, requiring access to system resources), K3k recommends minimizing these privileges whenever possible and adhering to the principle of least privilege. This can be achieved by carefully configuring the necessary capabilities instead of relying on full privileged mode. Further information on K3s security best practices can be found in the official K3s documentation: https://docs.k3s.io/security (This link provides general security guidance, including discussions of capabilities and other relevant topics). Currently, security in virtual mode has a risk of privilege escalation as the server pods run with elevated privileges due to the nature of their function, requiring access to system resources. K3k consists of two main components: Controller: The K3k controller is a core component that runs on the host cluster. It watches for Cluster custom resources (CRs) and manages the lifecycle of virtual clusters. When a new Cluster CR is created, the controller provisions the necessary resources, including namespaces, K3s server and agent pods, and network configurations, to create the virtual cluster. CLI: The K3k CLI provides a command-line interface for interacting with K3k. It allows users to easily create, manage, and access virtual clusters. The CLI simplifies common tasks such as creating Cluster CRs, retrieving kubeconfigs for accessing virtual clusters, and performing other management operations. K3k introduces the VirtualClusterPolicy Custom Resource, a way to set up and apply common configurations and how your virtual clusters operate within the K3k environment. The primary goal of VCPs is to allow administrators to centrally manage and apply consistent policies. This reduces repetitive configuration, helps meet organizational standards, and enhances the security and operational consistency of virtual clusters managed by K3k. A VirtualClusterPolicy is bound to one or more Kubernetes Namespaces. Once bound, the rules defined in the VCP apply to all K3k virtual clusters that are running or get created in that Namespace. This allows for flexible policy application, meaning different Namespaces can use their own unique VCPs, while others can share a single VCP for a consistent setup. Common use cases for administrators leveraging VirtualClusterPolicy include: Defining the operational mode (like \"shared\" or \"virtual\") for virtual clusters. Setting up resource quotas and limit ranges to effectively manage how much resources virtual clusters and their workloads can use. Enforcing security standards, for example, by configuring Pod Security Admission (PSA) labels for Namespaces. The K3k controller actively monitors VirtualClusterPolicy resources and the corresponding Namespace bindings. When a VCP is applied or updated, the controller ensures that the defined configurations are enforced on the relevant virtual clusters and their associated resources within the targeted Namespaces. For a deep dive into what VirtualClusterPolicy can do, along with more examples, check out the VirtualClusterPolicy Concepts page. For a full list of all the spec fields, see the API Reference for VirtualClusterPolicy. K3k offers two distinct modes for deploying virtual clusters: shared and virtual. Each mode has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice depends on the specific needs and priorities of the user. Here’s a comparison to help you make an informed decision: Feature Shared Mode Virtual Mode Architecture Agentless K3s server with Virtual Kubelet Full K3s cluster (server and agents) as pods Isolation Network Policies Dedicated control plane and worker nodes as pods Resource Sharing Dynamic, namespace-level ResourceQuotas Resource limits on virtual cluster pods Networking Host cluster’s CNI + Host cluster’s Ingress Controller (option) Virtual cluster’s own CNI + Virtual cluster’s own Ingress Controller Storage Host cluster’s storage Bring your own storage provider Security Pod Security Admission (PSA), Network Policies Inherent isolation, PSA, Network Policies Performance Smaller footprint, more efficient due to running directly on the host Higher overhead due to running full K3s clusters Trade-offs: Isolation vs. Overhead: The shared mode has lower overhead but weaker isolation, while the virtual mode provides stronger isolation but potentially higher overhead due to running full K3s clusters. Resource Sharing: The shared mode offers dynamic resource sharing within a namespace, which can be efficient but less predictable. The virtual mode provides dedicated resources to each virtual cluster, offering more control but requiring careful planning. For more information on how to choose the right mode, see Choose Mode.","title":"Architecture","component":"k3k","version":"latest","name":"architecture","url":"/k3k/latest/en/architecture.html","titles":[{"text":"Shared Mode","hash":"_shared_mode","id":1},{"text":"Networking and Storage","hash":"_networking_and_storage","id":2},{"text":"Resource Sharing and Limits","hash":"_resource_sharing_and_limits","id":3},{"text":"Isolation and Security","hash":"_isolation_and_security","id":4},{"text":"Virtual Mode","hash":"_virtual_mode","id":5},{"text":"Networking and Storage","hash":"_networking_and_storage_2","id":6},{"text":"Resource Sharing and Limits","hash":"_resource_sharing_and_limits_2","id":7},{"text":"Isolation and Security","hash":"_isolation_and_security_2","id":8},{"text":"K3k Components","hash":"_k3k_components","id":9},{"text":"VirtualClusterPolicy","hash":"_virtualclusterpolicy","id":10},{"text":"Comparison and Trade-offs","hash":"_comparison_and_trade_offs","id":11}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"K3k, a key feature of SUSE Rancher Prime, brings together the lightweight power of the open source engine K3k and the enterprise-grade management capabilities of SUSE Virtual Cluster Management.

It enables multi-tenancy, experimentation and resource isolation, reducing infrastructure costs by allowing you to run multiple lightweight Kubernetes clusters on the same physical host. K3k offers both \"shared\" mode, optimizing resource utilization, and \"virtual\" mode, providing complete isolation with dedicated K3s server pods. This allows you to access a full Kubernetes experience without the overhead of managing separate physical resources. K3k integrates with Rancher for simplified management of your embedded clusters. This section provides instructions on how to install K3k and the k3kcli. Helm must be installed to use the charts. Please refer to Helm’s documentation to get started. An existing RKE2 Kubernetes cluster (recommended). A configured storage provider with a default storage class. If you do not have a storage provider, you can configure the cluster to use ephemeral or static storage. Please consult the k3kcli Advanced Usage for instructions on using these options. Rancher Prime customers, please see Quick Start. Add the K3k Helm repository: helm repo add k3k https://rancher.github.io/k3k helm repo update Install the K3k controller: helm install --namespace k3k-system --create-namespace k3k k3k/k3k The k3kcli provides a quick and easy way to create K3k clusters and automatically exposes them via a kubeconfig. To install it, simply download the latest available version for your architecture from the GitHub Releases page. For example, you can download the Linux amd64 version with: wget -qO k3kcli https://github.com/rancher/k3k/releases/download/v1.0.0/k3kcli-linux-amd64 && \\ chmod +x k3kcli && \\ sudo mv k3kcli /usr/local/bin Now run: k3kcli --version k3kcli version v1.0.0 This section provides examples of how to use the k3kcli to manage your K3k clusters. K3k operates within the context of your currently configured kubectl context. This means that K3k respects the standard Kubernetes mechanisms for context configuration, including the --kubeconfig flag, the $KUBECONFIG environment variable, and the default $HOME/.kube/config file. Any K3k clusters you create will reside within the Kubernetes cluster that your kubectl is currently pointing to. To create a new K3k cluster, use the following command: k3kcli cluster create mycluster Creating a K3k Cluster on a Rancher-Managed Host Cluster If your host Kubernetes cluster is managed by Rancher (for example, your kubeconfig’s server address includes a Rancher URL), use the --kubeconfig-server flag when creating your K3k cluster: k3kcli cluster create --kubeconfig-server mycluster This ensures the generated kubeconfig connects to the correct endpoint. When the K3s server is ready, k3kcli will generate the necessary kubeconfig file and print instructions on how to use it. Here’s an example of the output: INFO[0000] Creating a new cluster [mycluster] INFO[0000] Extracting Kubeconfig for [mycluster] cluster INFO[0000] waiting for cluster to be available..

By using VCPs, administrators can centrally manage these aspects, reducing manual configuration, ensuring alignment with organizational standards, and enhancing the overall security and operational consistency of the K3k environment. Using a combination of RKE2 and Cilium in the host cluster could result in issues with network policies. The recommended solution is to use VirtualClusterPolicy to disable network policy setup with K3k. A VirtualClusterPolicy is a cluster-scoped Kubernetes Custom Resource that specifies a set of rules and configurations. These policies are then applied to K3k virtual clusters (Cluster resources) operating within Kubernetes Namespaces that are explicitly bound to a VCP. To apply a VirtualClusterPolicy to one or more Namespaces (and thus to all K3k Cluster resources within those Namespaces), you need to label the desired Namespace(s). Add the following label to your Namespace metadata: `policy.k3k.io/policy-name: ` Example: Labeling a Namespace apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace metadata: name: my-app-namespace labels: policy.k3k.io/policy-name: \"standard-dev-policy\" In this example, my-app-namespace will adhere to the rules defined in the VirtualClusterPolicy named standard-dev-policy. Multiple Namespaces can be bound to the same policy for uniform configuration, or different Namespaces can be bound to distinct policies. It’s also important to note what happens when a Namespace’s policy binding changes. If a Namespace is unbound from a VirtualClusterPolicy (by removing the policy.k3k.io/policy-name label), K3k will clean up and remove the resources (such as ResourceQuotas, LimitRanges, and managed Namespace labels) that were originally applied by that policy. Similarly, if the label is changed to bind the Namespace to a new VirtualClusterPolicy, K3k will first remove the resources associated with the old policy before applying the configurations from the new one, ensuring a clean transition. If you create a VirtualClusterPolicy without specifying any spec fields (for example, using k3kcli policy create my-default-policy), it will be created with default settings. Currently, this includes spec.allowedMode being set to shared. # Example of a minimal VCP (after creation with defaults) apiVersion: k3k.io/v1beta1 kind: VirtualClusterPolicy metadata: name: my-default-policy spec: allowedMode: shared A VirtualClusterPolicy can configure several aspects of the Namespaces it’s bound to and the virtual clusters operating within them. You can restrict the mode (e.g., \"shared\" or \"virtual\") in which K3k Cluster resources can be provisioned within bound Namespaces. If a Cluster is created in a bound Namespace with a mode not allowed in allowedMode, its creation might proceed but an error should be reported in the Cluster resource’s status. Example: Allow only \"shared\" mode clusters. apiVersion: k3k.io/v1beta1 kind: VirtualClusterPolicy metadata: name: shared-only-policy spec: allowedModeTypes: - shared You can also specify this using the CLI: k3kcli policy create --mode shared shared-only-policy (or --mode virtual). You can define resource consumption limits for bound Namespaces by specifying a ResourceQuota. K3k will create a ResourceQuota object in each bound Namespace with the provided specifications. Example: Set CPU, memory, and pod limits. apiVersion: k3k.io/v1beta1 kind: VirtualClusterPolicy metadata: name: quota-policy spec: quota: hard: cpu: \"10\" memory: \"20Gi\" pods: \"10\" You can define default resource requests/limits and min/max constraints for containers running in bound Namespaces by specifying a LimitRange. K3k will create a LimitRange object in each bound Namespace. Example: Define default CPU requests/limits and min/max CPU. apiVersion: k3k.io/v1beta1 kind: VirtualClusterPolicy metadata: name: limit-policy spec: limit: limits: - default: cpu: \"500m\" defaultRequest: cpu: \"500m\" max: cpu: \"1\" min: cpu: \"100m\" type: Container By default, K3k creates a NetworkPolicy in bound Namespaces to provide network isolation for virtual clusters (especially in shared mode). You can disable the creation of this default policy. Example: Disable the default NetworkPolicy. apiVersion: k3k.io/v1beta1 kind: VirtualClusterPolicy metadata: name: no-default-netpol-policy spec: disableNetworkPolicy: true You can enforce Pod Security Standards (PSS) by specifying a Pod Security Admission (PSA) level. K3k applies the corresponding PSA labels to each bound Namespace. The allowed values are privileged, baseline, restricted, and this adds labels like pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: to the bound Namespace. Example: Enforce the \"baseline\" PSS level. apiVersion: k3k.io/v1beta1 kind: VirtualClusterPolicy metadata: name: baseline-psa-policy spec: podSecurityAdmissionLevel: baseline For a complete reference of all VirtualClusterPolicy spec fields, see API Reference for VirtualClusterPolicy.

If you are unsure, start with Shared mode - it is the default and fits most common scenarios. Best for: Developers who want to run workloads quickly without managing Kubernetes internals Platform teams that require visibility and control over all workloads Users who need access to host-level resources (For example, GPUs) In Shared mode, the virtual cluster runs its own K3s server but relies on the host to execute workloads. The virtual kubelet syncs resources, enabling lightweight, fast provisioning with support for cluster resource isolation. More details on the architecture. \"I’m building a web app that should be exposed outside the virtual cluster.\" → Use Shared mode. It allows you to expose your application. \"`I need to run Jupyter notebooks that leverage the cluster’s GPU.`\" → Use Shared mode. It gives access to physical devices while keeping overhead low. \"I want to monitor and secure all tenant workloads from a central location.\" → Use Shared mode. Host-level agents (for example, observability, policy enforcement) work across all virtual clusters. \"I need to enforce security policies like network policies or runtime scanning across all workloads.\" → Use Shared mode. The platform can enforce policies globally without tenant bypass. \"I need to test a new admission controller or policy engine.\" → Use Shared mode, if it is scoped to your virtual cluster. You can run tools like Kubewarden without affecting the host. \"I want to spin up disposable virtual clusters per pipeline run, fast and with low resource cost.\" → Use Shared mode. Its quick to provision and ideal for short-lived, namespace-scoped environments. Best for: Advanced users who need full Kubernetes isolation Developers testing experimental or cluster-wide features Use cases requiring control over the entire Kubernetes control plane In Virtual mode, the virtual cluster runs its own isolated Kubernetes control plane. It supports different CNIs, and API configurations — ideal for deep experimentation or advanced workloads. More details on the architecture. \"I need to test a new Kubernetes feature gate that is disabled in the host cluster.\" → Use Virtual mode. You can configure your own control plane flags and API features. \"We are testing upgrades across Kubernetes versions, including new API behaviors.\" → Use Virtual mode. You can run different Kubernetes versions and safely validate upgrade paths. \"I’m evaluating a new CNI that needs full control of the cluster’s networking.\" → Use Virtual mode. You can run a separate CNI stack without affecting the host or other tenants. \"I’m testing a new admission controller and policy engine before rolling it out cluster-wide.\" → Use Virtual mode, if you need to test cluster-wide policies, custom admission flow, or advanced extensions with full control. If you are evaluating more advanced use cases or want a deeper comparison, see the full trade-off breakdown in the Architecture documentation.","title":"How to Choose Between Shared and Virtual Mode","component":"k3k","version":"latest","name":"choose-mode","url":"/k3k/latest/en/how-tos-for-admin/choose-mode.html","titles":[{"text":"Shared Mode (default)","hash":"_shared_mode_default","id":1},{"text":"Use Cases by Persona","hash":"_use_cases_by_persona","id":2},{"text":"Developer","hash":"_developer","id":3},{"text":"Data Scientist:","hash":"_data_scientist","id":4},{"text":"Platform Admin","hash":"_platform_admin","id":5},{"text":"Security Engineer","hash":"_security_engineer","id":6},{"text":"CI/CD Engineer","hash":"_cicd_engineer","id":7},{"text":"Virtual Mode","hash":"_virtual_mode","id":8},{"text":"Use Cases by Persona","hash":"_use_cases_by_persona_2","id":9},{"text":"Developer","hash":"_developer_2","id":10},{"text":"Platform Admin","hash":"_platform_admin_2","id":11},{"text":"Network Engineer","hash":"_network_engineer","id":12},{"text":"Security Engineer","hash":"_security_engineer_2","id":13},{"text":"Additional information","hash":"_additional_information","id":14}]},"8":{"id":8,"text":"This guide explains how to expose the Kubernetes API of the virtual clusters to external networks. Practices apply to both virtual mode and shared mode. It is important to add the TLS-SAN arguments to the cluster, such that the IP address or host are not rejected. Running k3kcli cluster delete clustername will delete the virtual cluster but will not cascade to the ingresses or services created using the following methods. It is possible to expose the virtual cluster’s Kubernetes API through an ingress controller present on the host. However, it is important to note that TLS termination must be performed at the virtual cluster, requiring some changes from normal ingress objects. In case of Traefik, the virtual cluster’s API is exposed through an IngressRouteTCP resource. Here’s an example configuration: apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1 kind: IngressRouteTCP metadata: name: cluster-ingress-rt spec: entryPoints: - websecure routes: - match: HostSNI(`cluster.example.com`) services: - name: k3k-clustername-service port: 443 tls: passthrough: true Ingress Nginx does not have SSL passthrough enabled out of the box and must be enabled with the --enable-ssl-passthrough flag. Refer to the ingress-nginx documentation {https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/tls/#ssl-passthrough}[here]. Afterwards, it is possible to create a normal ingress resource with the annotation \"nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough\". For example: apiVersion: networking.k8s.io kind: Ingress metadata: annotations: nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough: \"true\" nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: \"https\" name: cluster-ingress spec: rules: - host: cluster.example.com http: paths: - backend: service: name: k3k-clustername-service port: number: 443 path: / pathType: Prefix The services created at creation time of the virtual cluster cannot be modified. It is necessary to create a new service of the desired type (LoadBalancer or NodePort). If a load balancer is available to the host cluster, either from a cloud service provider or from an add-on such as MetalLB, it is possible to expose the virtual cluster’s API over its own unique IP address. For an example cluster called test in the namespace k3k_test, create a LoadBalancer service with the following command: kubectl -n k3k_test expose service k3k-test-service --type=LoadBalancer --name=k3k-test-servicelb In the absence of the above solutions, the virtual Kubernetes API can be exposed over a NodePort service using the IP address of any of the host nodes. For an example cluster named test in the namespace k3k_test, create a NodePort service using the following command: kubectl -n k3k_test expose service k3k-test-service --type=NodePort --name=k3k-test-servicenp","title":"How-to: Expose Virtual Cluster Kubernetes API","component":"k3k","version":"latest","name":"expose-kubernetesapi","url":"/k3k/latest/en/how-tos-for-admin/expose-kubernetesapi.html","titles":[{"text":"Ingress","hash":"_ingress","id":1},{"text":"Traefik","hash":"_traefik","id":2},{"text":"Ingress Nginx","hash":"_ingress_nginx","id":3},{"text":"Service","hash":"_service","id":4},{"text":"LoadBalancer","hash":"_loadbalancer","id":5},{"text":"NodePort","hash":"_nodeport","id":6}]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"This document provides information on provisioning the K3k cluster uisng the add-ons feature.

Behavior varies depending on the operating mode of the virtual cluster. In virtual mode, direct external exposure of workloads is not available. This mode is designed for strong isolation and does not expose the virtual cluster’s network directly. In shared mode, workloads can be exposed to the external network using standard Kubernetes service types or an ingress controller, depending on your requirements. `Services` are always synced from the virtual cluster to the host cluster following the same principle described here for pods. To expose a service such as a web application outside the host cluster: NodePort: Exposes the service on a static port on each node’s IP. Access the service at http://:;. LoadBalancer: Provisions an external load balancer (if supported by the environment) and exposes the service via the load balancer’s IP. The LoadBalancer IP is currently not reflected back to the virtual cluster service. k3k issue #365 If the workload should only be accessible to other services or pods within the host cluster: Use the ClusterIP service type. This exposes the service on an internal IP, only reachable inside the host cluster. For more advanced routing, such as hostname- or path-based routing, deploy an Ingress controller in the virtual cluster, and expose it via NodePort or LoadBalancer. This allows you to: Define Ingress resources in the virtual cluster. Route external traffic to services within the virtual cluster. To use the host ingress controller, enable sync.ingresses. Since, ingresses are synced with the host cluster, virtual cluster users don’t need to deploy an ingress Controller. apiVersion: k3k.io/v1beta1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: k3kcluster-shared-mode spec: mode: shared ... sync: ingresses: enabled: true With this sync enabled, certificate can also be issued by the host cluster. For example, certificate can be issued if you’re using Cert-Manager.","title":"How-to: Expose Workloads Outside the Virtual Cluster","component":"k3k","version":"latest","name":"expose-workloads","url":"/k3k/latest/en/how-tos-for-user/expose-workloads.html","titles":[{"text":"Virtual Mode","hash":"_virtual_mode","id":1},{"text":"Shared Mode","hash":"_shared_mode","id":2},{"text":"Option 1: Use NodePort or LoadBalancer","hash":"_option_1_use_nodeport_or_loadbalancer","id":3},{"text":"Option 2: Use ClusterIP for Internal Communication","hash":"_option_2_use_clusterip_for_internal_communication","id":4},{"text":"Option 3: Use Ingress for HTTP/HTTPS Routing","hash":"_option_3_use_ingress_for_httphttps_routing","id":5},{"text":"Options 4: Use Host Ingress","hash":"_options_4_use_host_ingress","id":6}]},"12":{"id":12,"text":"This section contains common troubleshooting steps for K3K virtual clusters.

To view logs for a failed virtual cluster: kubectl logs -n k3k-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=k3k This retrieves logs from K3k controller components. To view logs for a failed virtual cluster: kubectl logs -n -l cluster= This retrieves logs from K3k cluster components (agents, server and virtual-kubelet). You can also use kubectl describe cluster to check for recent events and status conditions. Some of the most common causes are related to missing prerequisites or wrong configuration. When creating a Virtual Cluster with dynamic persistence, a PVC is needed. You can check if the PVC was claimed but not bound with kubectl get pvc -n . If you see a pending PVC you probably don’t have a default storage class defined, or you have specified a wrong one. The pvc is pending: kubectl get pvc -n k3k-test-storage NAME STATUS VOLUME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES STORAGECLASS VOLUMEATTRIBUTESCLASS AGE varlibrancherk3s-k3k-test-storage-server-0 Pending not-available 4s The server is pending: kubectl get po -n k3k-test-storage NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE k3k-test-storage-kubelet-j4zn5 1/1 Running 0 54s k3k-test-storage-server-0 0/1 Pending 0 54s To fix this you should use a valid storage class, you can list existing storage class using: kubectl get storageclasses.storage.k8s.io NAME PROVISIONER RECLAIMPOLICY VOLUMEBINDINGMODE ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION AGE local-path (default) rancher.io/local-path Delete WaitForFirstConsumer false 3d6h When creating a Virtual Cluster with defaultNodeSelector, if the selector is not valid all pods will be pending.
